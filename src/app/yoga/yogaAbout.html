			<p class="content--yoga--about__subheader">KRIPALU YOGA</p>
				
				<p>My training has been in Kripalu Yoga, which is a style of yoga that is based primarily off of the teachings of Swami Kripalu, Hatha Yoga and the Eight-limbed Yoga Path as compiled by yogi Patanjali. Kripalu Yoga looks at developing the whole person through not only moral and ethical practices (the Yamas and the Niyamas) but also through nonjudgmental, passionate self-awareness. For myself, yoga is more than just the practice of postures (asana), but a way of living in this world with compassion for myself and for others.</p>
				
				<p>Kripalu Yoga is an integrated system of self-transformation that empowers you to realize your full potential. The journey begins as you revitalize the body through postures, breathing exercises, and relaxation techniques. It deepens as you learn to focus awareness, enabling you to enter meditative states that awaken compassion and clear the mind. Through the practice of Kripalu Yoga, you discover how to nurture the roots of health, catalyze personal growth, live with greater skillfulness and joy, and transform your sense of what it means to be alive.</p>

			<p class="content--yoga--about__subheader">MY YOGA PRACTICE AND STYLE</p>
				
				<p>I am a graduate of the 200-hour Kripalu Yoga Teacher Training and I have been practicing yoga since 2009. In my classes I incorporate asana (posture) practice, pranayama (yogic breathing techniques) and meditation. The themes of my classes change, but it is always my intention to help my students cultivate body-mind awareness in a safe, supported environment. I look forward to exploring yoga with you in the future! If you have any questions about my experience, qualifications, or story please donâ€™t hesitate to let me know.</p>
