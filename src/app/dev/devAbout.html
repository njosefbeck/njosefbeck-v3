				<p class="content--dev--about__content">Coding has been a passion of mine since middle school when I took my first HTML class with my dad, learning about scrolling marquees and hyperlinks. From there my journey continued as I made websites for my personal hobbies. When I went off to college my focus shifted to Spanish and education. Coding took an unfortunate backseat!</p>
				<p class="content--dev--about__content">As an educator fresh out of graduate school, I began to develop an online presence as a way to connect with other teachers. Stepping back into the world of web development after many years was a bit overwhelming. Boy how the net had changed! But, I was motivated and a dedicated student and so perserved.</p>
				<p class="content--dev--about__content">Over the years of my teaching career I dove into as many of the online learn-to-code sites as possible. I took e-courses through Udemy, I almost exhausted Codecademy, I wrung out all I could from Club Treehouse and Code School. As time went on I found myself drawn more and more to front-end code. Enjoying the visual aspect of the experience, and being able to shape how a user interacted with my content, really drove me to focus my attention on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
				<p class="content--dev--about__content">As I dove deeper into code, I realized that, though I was passionate about teaching, I also was passionate about helping others craft their web presence. It was a creative and challenging task that resonated with me so much that I decided to switch careers and make a go at being a front-end web developer. This is when things got real.</p>
				<p class="content--dev--about__content">After not being sure about how to go from Spanish teacher to developer, a friend recommended I look into online boot camps. Enter bloc.io. Bloc was a good choice and helped me immensely to close some of my knowledge gap about modern web development. Through their coursework, my projects, and the amazing support of my mentor Ricardo Vasquez, I was able to progress and level up my development skills.</p>
				<p class="content--dev--about__content">Bloc opened the door for me, allowing me to step into the world of dev jobs and not completely embarrass myself. And I did it! I found a lovely job and transitioned careers. Every day I learn something new. I realize that my journey into development has just begun and I look forward to what's on the horizon!</p>
